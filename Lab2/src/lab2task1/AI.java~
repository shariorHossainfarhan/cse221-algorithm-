/*Write a java program named AI that has two members, A1 and B1, an empty constructor that will assign empty values to the members, 
 * and a parameterized constructor that will assign values to the members. It has a method named experiment that will use
 * method overloading. The first experiment method will determine if the first member is a multiple of second member. 
 * The second experiment method will calculate the following expression A1^(B1+C1). Call the experiment method inside the main class, 
 * Write a discussion of the above code. */
