/*Write a java program that will have a class named series which will have two methods, 
 * first 
 * will compute the following series 1^3+4^3+7^3+10^3+…..+N^3 (the value of N will be given by the user) ,
 * and the second method will compute the factorial of all the integers from 1 to N. Call the methods inside the main class. 
 * Write a discussion of this code. */
